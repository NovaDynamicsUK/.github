# Mission Statement
**Evolve - Secure - Inspire**

Our mission is to secure systems, inspire innovation, and contribute to causes that make a meaningful impact. We collaborate on open-source projects, support organisations such as TraceLabs, and utilise our skills to build a safer, more connected world.

At NovaDynamics, *a private unincorporated association*, we aim to:

- **Evolve**: Continuously push the boundaries of what is possible in cybersecurity and digital innovation, exploring emerging technologies and adapting to ever-changing threats.
- **Secure**: Develop and implement robust security solutions that protect systems, data, and users. Where applicable, identify and showcase critical vulnerabilities for research and educational purposes, contributing to the global knowledge base.
- **Inspire**: Lead by example, mentoring the next generation of tech enthusiasts and developers. Share knowledge by writing articles, conducting open research, and publishing findings to foster growth and collaboration within the public domain.

Our focus on security by design, technological evolution, and community-driven inspiration is what sets us apart - especially when it comes to research and articles.

## What We Do

- **Ethical Hacking & Bounty Hunting**
We engage in ethical hacking, working alongside companies and organisations to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their security postures. Our team actively participates in bug bounty programmes and regularly contributes our findings to improve security frameworks globally. Such as CSI Linux, and Cyber Warfare CiC.

- **Open-Source Contributions**
We believe in the power of open-source. NovaDynamics contributes to a range of open-source tools and frameworks, accessible to all. Our public repositories include everything from vulnerability scanning tools to automation scripts across a range of fields.

- **STEM Education**
Inspiring future generations is a core value of NovaDynamics. We actively conduct research and write articles for those interested in technology, providing resources and guidance.

- **Collaboration with Others**
We proudly support and collaborate with organisations such as TraceLabs, assisting with missing person investigations by utilising our technical expertise. We contribute our skills to further their cause and aid their global search operations. Likewise for CSI Linux and the Cyber Warfare CiC

## Values

At NovaDynamics, we believe in:
- **Transparency**: We are open about our research and reference sources in our articles whenever possible. While we cannot guarantee that all our projects will be open-source, those that are will come with flexible and fair licences for public use.
- **Collaboration**: We work together and with our partners to build stronger, more secure systems. To forster collaboration means to evolve and inspire. Together.
- **Empowerment**: By sharing knowledge and resources, we empower individuals and organisations to take control of their digital platforms.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects we are working on:

- **NovaOS**: A lightweight, security-centric operating system built with LFS and optimised as a secure environments.
- **Sol**: A multi-server Discord bot designed for moderation, backed by intelligent security features and support for large communities!
- **ADA & TG**: ADA stands for *Astronomical Data Analysis* for *TerraGuard*.

#### *More about ADA & TG*...
ADA-TG, *Astronomical Data Analysis & Terrestrial Guard*, is a dual-system designed to collect, analyse, and predict space, orbital, and terrestrial data trends that may pose potential threats to humanity. It utilises Machine Learning and live API data to archive, analyse, and formulate predictions, providing real-time alerts when thresholds are met.
